      I finally managed to completely add support for Minecraft mods to my Blog. From now on, every mod and mod update that I publish on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com "Checkout modrinth!") will be linked here as well.
      <br>
      This is to make it easier for everyone to discover and play my mods.
      <br>
      Also, I made it possible to filter for Categories, so you can easily find all posts in the Category ["MINECRAFT MOD"](/blog?c=mcmod) by clicking on the category anywhere you can find it.
      <br>
      Lastly I rewrote the site with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) to make it build faster when I make changes to it and to make the code more readable for me or anyone wanting to contribute, to continue development on it.
      <br>
      In the future I'll also be improving the download link and adding an advanced filter to the main [Blog page](https://arbeeco.de/blog), if I can figure out how to properly do it of course.<br>

      *Arbee over and out!*
